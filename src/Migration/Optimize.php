     *
     * Unfortunately, due to the scope of the optimization (two combinable
     * operations might be separated by several
     * hundred others), this can't be done as a peephole optimization with
     * checks/output implemented on
     * the Operations themselves; instead, the optimizer looks at each
     * individual operation and scans forwards in
     * the list to see if there are any matches, stopping at
     * boundaries - operations which can't  be optimized over
     * (RunSQL, operations on the same field/model, etc.).
     *
     * The inner loop is run until the starting list is the same as the result
     * list, and then the result is returned.
     * This means that operation optimization must be stable and always return
     * an equal or shorter list.
